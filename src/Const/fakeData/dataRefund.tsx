        <h6 className="h6">Complete Refund Eligibility:</h6>
        <p>
          A complete refund of the Service Fee, excluding GST, will be issued if
          the Company fails to share any CVs with the Employer for the requested
          position(s). Such a refund shall be processed within forty-five (45)
          days from the date of acknowledgment of the failure.
        </p>

        <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">
          Change in Employer’s Requirement Criteria:
        </h6>
        <p>
          In cases where the Employer alters the requirement criteria after
          submission of the Employer Detail Form, including but not limited to
          regional, gender, or caste-religion preferences that were not
          initially disclosed, and the Company is unable to fulfill the revised
          requirements, a partial refund may be issued. The refund amount will
          be determined based on: <br />- The number of CVs shared; <br /> - The
          time invested; - The work completed by the Company.
        </p>

          Partial Fulfillment of Vacancies:
        </h6>
        <p>
          If the Company receives a request to fill multiple vacancies (e.g.,
          five) and successfully fulfills some (e.g., three), but fails to fill
          the remaining vacancies due to reasons such as:
          <br />- Low salary offers;
          <br />- Undesirable job locations;
          <br />- Other constraints not agreed upon;
          <br />
          and the Employer does not agree to cooperate or make necessary
          adjustments, a partial refund will be processed. This refund will
          apply only to the unfulfilled vacancies. No refund will be provided
          for the vacancies that have already been successfully filled by the
          Company.

          Candidate Withdrawal Post-Selection:
        </h6>
        <p className="mb-4">
          No refund will be provided if a candidate, after being selected,
          decides to withdraw due to:
          <br />
          - Modifications in the terms and conditions of employment;
          <br />
          - Undisclosed conditions to the Company;
          <br />- Changes in the salary bracket by the Employer that were not
          communicated to the Company at the outset.

          Employer's Delay in Feedback:
        </h6>
        <p className="mb-4">
          No refund will be issued if the Employer fails to provide timely
          feedback or respond to shared profiles and arranged interviews,
          resulting in:
          <br />
          - Candidates losing interest;
          <br />
          - Delays in the recruitment process;
          <br />- Unfulfilled requirements.

          You are responsible for selecting candidates after conducting
          technical rounds. The company has no involvement in this process.
          Therefore, if you find the candidate unsuitable after they have
          joined, there will be no refund.

          If you select a candidate and, after your discussion and mutual
          agreement, you provide payment to them, and the candidate denies
          joining or elopes after joining, the company is not responsible and
          not liable for a refund.
